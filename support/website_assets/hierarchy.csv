Civil Liberties,Anti-Slapp,Civil Rights,Civil Liberties,Anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP),"SLAPPs -- Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation -- are used, often by corporations, to silence and harass critics by forcing them to spend money to defend themselves from baseless lawsuits. Anti-SLAPP laws protect speech in connection with a government agency or forum from lawsuit. Victims of a SLAAP can collect a fine and attorneys fees from those misusing a SLAAP.",

,x,Civil Rights,Criminal Justice Rights,Limiting State and Local Participation in Secure Communities,"Secure Communities is a program of the Dept of Homeland Security's US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency ostensibly intended to identify and deport dangerous non-citizens previously convicted of crimes. Whereas local and state law enforcement have traditionally run fingerprint checks for every person booked into jail against the FBI's IAFIS criminal database, Secure Communities also runs those fingerprints against DHS's IDENT database and allows ICE to request detainers on individuals who match. in fact, half the people arrested and deported under S-Comm or more have not previously been convicted of a serious crime. By subjecting individuals with no or minor criminal convictions to deportation, S-Comm disrupts families and communities, encourages racial and ethnic profiling, and burdens taxpayers. After originally agreeing to allow communities to opt-out of the program, DHS subsequently refused to allow opting out and in 2013 will make participation mandatory. Cook County, IL has refused to cooperate with the program and both California and DC have passed legislation limiting local compliance. ",

This prohibition is commonly understood to apply to the granting of “in-state” residency status for tuition purposes. Legislation to amend this federal law has routinely been introduced in previous Congresses, and several similar bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress, including H.R. 1751, S. 729, and H.R. 4321. Meanwhile, some states have passed laws aimed at making unauthorized state residents eligible for in-state tuition without violating this provision. . ",

This prohibition is commonly understood to apply to the granting of “in-state” residency status for tuition purposes. Legislation to amend this federal law has routinely been introduced in previous Congresses, and several similar bills have been introduced in the 111th Congress, including H.R. 1751, S. 729, and H.R. 4321. Meanwhile, some states have passed laws aimed at making unauthorized state residents eligible for in-state tuition without violating this provision. . ",

Recently at issue is the power of state and local law enforcement to make arrests or otherwise enforce the civil provisions of the immigration laws. Turning local police into the inS deters immigrants from accessing or cooperating with the police for fear of immigration consequences. When immigrants are afraid to file claims with administrative agencies, call the police, or go to court, immigrants can’t benefit from the protections of law enforcement. Claiming that state and local law enforcement officers have the inherent authority to enforce federal immigration laws wholly contradicts the long-standing principle that immigration matters are a federal concern and would render sections of the inA detailing the conditions for state and local enforcement of immigration laws meaningless. Comprehensive model language would include the points outlined in the Model Confidentiality Provisions in addition to a clear prohibition on the use of state and local resources for immigration law enforcement.",

Policing,Secure Communities Opt-out,Public Safety,Local and State Enforcement of Federal Law,Limiting State and Local Participation in Secure Communities,"Secure Communities is a program of the Dept of Homeland Security's US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency ostensibly intended to identify and deport dangerous non-citizens previously convicted of crimes. Whereas local and state law enforcement have traditionally run fingerprint checks for every person booked into jail against the FBI's IAFIS criminal database, Secure Communities also runs those fingerprints against DHS's IDENT database and allows ICE to request detainers on individuals who match. in fact, half the people arrested and deported under S-Comm or more have not previously been convicted of a serious crime. By subjecting individuals with no or minor criminal convictions to deportation, S-Comm disrupts families and communities, encourages racial and ethnic profiling, and burdens taxpayers. After originally agreeing to allow communities to opt-out of the program, DHS subsequently refused to allow opting out and in 2013 will make participation mandatory. Cook County, IL has refused to cooperate with the program and both California and DC have passed legislation limiting local compliance. ",
,,Public Safety,Local and State Enforcement of Federal Law,Prohibition on Local Enforcement of Immigration Laws,"The Immigration and Nationality Act (inA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) authorize state and local police to enforce the criminal provisions of federal immigration laws. Recently at issue is the power of state and local law enforcement to make arrests or otherwise enforce the civil provisions of the immigration laws. Turning local police into the inS deters immigrants from accessing or cooperating with the police for fear of immigration consequences. When immigrants are afraid to file claims with administrative agencies, call the police, or go to court, immigrants can’t benefit from the protections of law enforcement. Claiming that state and local law enforcement officers have the inherent authority to enforce federal immigration laws wholly contradicts the long-standing principle that immigration matters are a federal concern and would render sections of the inA detailing the conditions for state and local enforcement of immigration laws meaningless. Comprehensive model language would include the points outlined in the Model Confidentiality Provisions in addition to a clear prohibition on the use of state and local resources for immigration law enforcement.",

A number of states have passed legislation both to prohibit racial profiling and to collect statistics on arrests and the stopping of cars. For example, New Jersey enacted a law in 2003 that makes racial profiling by police a felony, while North Carolina makes all data collected on profiling by the police available to the public.",
