If all motorists paid for accident insurance per mile rather than in a lump sum, they would have an extra incentive to drive less. We estimate driving would decline by 8 percent nationwide, netting society the equivalent of about $50 billion to $60 billion a year by reducing driving-related harms. This driving reduction would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2 percent and oil consumption by about 4 percent. To put it in perspective, it would take a $1-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax to achieve the same reduction in driving. Unlike an increase in the gas tax, PAYD would save most drivers money regardless of where they live. We estimate almost two-thirds of households would pay less for auto insurance, with each of those households saving an average of $270 per car.

Any municipality or political subdivision may conduct instant runoff voting or use ranked-choice ballots.  Generally, if there is no simple majority winner, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and the process continues by counting the votes for the next most preferred candidate on those ballots where the eliminated candidate was the top choice.  The process continues until a winner by simple majority emerges or a tie results.  The procedure for breaking ties will remain the same as specified in Chapter 115, RSMo.  If necessary, election officials may limit the number of choices a voter may rank to three.  Write-in votes will still be allowed.

purchasing food grown within a defined geographic boundary are 
vulnerable to challenge under the U.S. Constitution’s restrictions on 
local and state laws that discriminate against goods and commerce from 
other states, known as the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine (DCCD). 
Policymakers and advocates for local food should understand the impact 
of these restrictions and should take advantage of an important 
exception to these restrictions when drafting policies to encourage 
purchase of locally grown food. In particular, they should (1) 
consider using the “market-participant exception” to the DCCD and tailor policies to apply to government’s direct food purchasing or agreements 
with food service contractors; (2) avoid using tax credits and instead 
use direct cash subsidies when providing incentives for local food 
purchasing by private (nongovern­mental) entities, and (3) make “locally
 grown” geographic definitions as broad as possible (especially to 
include out-of-state territory).",,,,"Locally Grown Food, Dormant Commerce Clause Doctrine, Economic Development, Public Contracting, Government Contracting, Government Procurement, Organic Food, ",

These policies differ in the extent to which pharmacists or patients can influence which medications they choose. Using national Medicaid data, we evaluated the relationship between different generic substitution policies and the use of generic simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, after the patent for the brand-name equivalent, Zocor, expired. States that implemented policies requiring patients’ consent prior to generic substitution experienced rates of substitution that were 25 percent lower than those of states that did not require patient consent. By eliminating patient consent requirements, state. Medicaid programs could expect to save more than $100 million in 
coverage for three top-selling medications that are nearing patent expiration. Although these consent requirements are probably intended to increase patient autonomy, policy 
makers should consider the sizable opportunity costs.
