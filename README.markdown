# Contributing

*  Clone the project and checkout the `develop` branch. All topic branches should be off of `develop`. 
*  From the project root, run `./script/bootstrap`.
*  Run the solr server with `./script/solr`.
*  All of the normal stuff you'd expect: Write tests. Run all of the tests for your commits.
*  Have fun.
